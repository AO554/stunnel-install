# stunnel-install(dot)sh

Heard of [openvpn-install?](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install) yeah, its basically that but for stunnel.

## How do I run it?

Simply put, you just download the script and run it as root

```
chmod +x stunnel-install.sh
sudo ./stunnel-install
```

## Compatible Distros
Debian/Ubuntu based
Redhat based -- Untested

## To-do (eventually)
- Automatic OS Detection
- Possible clean up (but its moderately clean already)
- OpenSSL Automation possibly
